        <h1>Astronomy Picture of the Day</h1>
        <p class="gen-text">Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) is originated, written, coordinated, and edited since 1995 by Robert Nemiroff and J
            erry Bonnell. The APOD archive contains the largest collection of annotated astronomical images on the internet.
            APOD in general and the APOD site served from NASA specifically places links solely on information content and does 
            not endorse any commercial product nor guarantee claims or sales made on any linked pages.
            In real life, Bob and Jerry are two professional astronomers who spend most of their time researching the universe. 
            Bob is a professor at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan, USA, while Jerry is a scientist 
            at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland USA. They are two married, mild and lazy guys who might 
            appear relatively normal to an unsuspecting guest. Together, they have found new and unusual ways of annoying people 
            such as staging astronomical debates. Most people are surprised to learn that they have developed the perfect random 
            number generator.<br><br>
